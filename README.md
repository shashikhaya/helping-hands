Helping Hands is a website designed for the front-end focused project of the Bright Newtork Technology Academy (BNTA).
Collaborators: Shashi Parekh, Zainuddin Siddiqi, Matthew Baines & Sixian Chen

The project is aimed to provide an intuitive, responsive website to connect vulnerable people who need help completing tasks such as going shopping or cleaning, with local vounteers willing to assist them.

The project is built in React and utilises the backend "Express the support", built by a different team in the previous back-end focused project of the BNTA.

"Express the support" uses express and mondoDB with mongoose and the repo can be found here: https://github.com/timstu98/ExpressTheSupport

A few minor edits were made to the backend to integrate it with our front and this up-to-date version, required to run the app, can be found here: https://github.com/z-siddiqi/ExpressTheSupport

To run Helping Hands, first run the express the support server using "npm start" in the servers directory, then use "npm start" in the helping hands directory.

THE FOLLOWING IS THE AUTO-GENERATED REACT DOCUMENTATION

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
